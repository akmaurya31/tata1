It offers a wide selection of clothes and accessories in the newest designs at reasonable costs, making fashion accessible to everyone. Zudio's collection includes sportswear, casual wear, and formal clothing for men, women, and children.</p>

Currently, there are 352 outlets throughout India, offering products in categories such as loungewear, footwear, kids' clothing, men's clothing, women's clothing, and beauty items.</p>
            
            <p>Zudio operates under the FOCO model (Franchise Owned, Company Operated), where the franchisee invests in the business, but the company supports and manages it on their behalf.
